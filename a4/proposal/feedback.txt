Your proposal is very general which makes it difficult to evaluate. It is unclear exactly what you plan to implement, or exactly how the user will interact with it. The image does nothing to mitigate this ambiguity, with unlabeled check-boxes and a add/rm course text field that it's unclear how to utilize.

You also identify only one challenge, although it is a reasonable one. Reading the proposal, several more challenges come to mind and I would like to be convinced that you have given it a little more thought.

While the core functionality you define in the first paragraph seems acceptable as a general idea, I'm uncomfortable giving a full green light to this assignment submission without more information in the proposal. Feel free to resubmit.
