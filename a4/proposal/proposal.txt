-We propose a widget that will check a student's enrolment information against their program's required courses, and display to the student what courses (or range of courses) are left to fulfill their program's requirements.
-How the user will intereact with it:
	-a checkbox identifying whether or not currently enrolled courses (for which there is no mark) are to be included in the calculation of required courses left. A change to this checkbox will result in the recalculation of required courses given the new constraints, and an update to the output view. (More checkboxes may be added if there are other forms of manipulating the courses used in the calculation that are later deemed useful)
	-an add/rm course text field wherein the user can add 'hypothetical enrolment information'.The user will provide a course subject and catalog number, and if the course described is not already within the saved array of user courses, that new course is added and the output view is updated with the new course added to its calculations. If the course described is already within the array of user courses, it would be removed, and the output view would be updated. If this proves too ambiguous, add/rm course may have to be converted into two separate text fields (add course, rm course, with appropriate handling of nonsensical input) and in all likelyhood this/these text fields will necessitate an added button to restore default courses to the array, as found using the users enrolment information. 

-Possible implementation challenges include: 
	-accessing undergraduate calendar information for multiple possible undergraduate programs. As such, it may become a necessity to limit the possible user-base to those within the Mathematics faculty. In the worst-case scenerio, we can simply hard-code the current BCS requirements. As this would greatly reduce the potential audience and future use, this is of course not optimal, but since its audience would still reflect a sizeable population, and since the BCS requirements seem to experience limited change from one year to the next, we believe this outcome would not be entirely unreasonable. 
	-condensing what will likely be quite a bit of information to print to the screen into a reasonable space. With the recent removal of height restrictions, this can be solved by merely formatting all output to minimize width while keeping all output in the same column (though ideally, for ease of reading, there will be at least two columns so the controllers and the view can be seen side-by-side, which will require more strategic formatting).
